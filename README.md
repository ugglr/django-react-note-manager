# django-react-note-manager

<p>In this project I am building a REST API using python: Django and Django Rest API framework.<br>
It is going to be a full CRUD application where the front-end is handled with React. 
</p>

<h4>Getting the app running locally</h4>
Make sure you have python3 and pipenv installed, and node.js installed. 

<ol>
  <li>Download/Clone Repo
  <li>Open terminal
  <li>Navigate to the root directory with the pip file in it. 
  <li>Activate the virtual env by typing "pipenv shell" in the terminal.
  <li>cd to notemanager and type "python manage.py runserver" this should start the server at localhost:8000
  <li>open another terminal and navigate to the root directory
  <li>run the command "npm install" to install all the node modules
  <li>run the command "npm run dev" which will trigger webpack and build the react code and serve the front-end to the django template. 
  <li>navigate to localhost:800 and try the app. 
</ol>
